              <p3>I’ve always been interested in robotics technology, how it works, and how it can be used to aid
                our everyday lives. Specifically, autonomous machines. While I was in high school, I wanted to work in a
                field where I could play a part in creating machines that have the ability to operate, and even think to an
                extent, on their own. This is one of the reasons why I chose Geomatics Engineering.</p3>
                <p></p>
              <p3> Now I’m a fourth year Geomatics
                Engineering student at The University of Calgary and once I graduate, I would like to put this dream into practice
                and play a part in designing autonomous machines. </p3>

                <p1>One of my interests is photography. Being able to capture and edit your scenes/portraits with your own twist
                  is one of the many reasons why I love it. </p1>
                <p></p>
                <p>I don’t usually like to spend my free time inside, so I’m always looking for ways to be active. Whether that
                  means mountain biking, playing hockey, or hiking up a mountain. This is great because I can combine it with photography,
                  giving me the opportunity to enjoy being outdoors while also taking some cool photos along the way. Make sure to check out
                  the My Photography tab to see some of my images and the Social tab to see my photography portfolio through the Instagram link.
